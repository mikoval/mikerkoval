        <p>
        As of January 2017 I am a senior at Georgia Tech studying computer science. I have one full semester of classes and after I will have one class left to finish to graduate. My specialization for my degree is in Computer Media and Artificial Intelligence. When first learning getting into programming and computer science as a whole, I wasn't sure what really interested me, but I really enjoyed being able to make something, and be able to see the results of my work. After taking the Georgia Tech intro to graphics classes I loved how I was able to create something. It felt so real, even though it wasn't. Although the classes were difficult, I really enjoyed them; they felt very rewarding. I have turned computer graphics into a hobby of mine and hope to pursue a career in the field.
